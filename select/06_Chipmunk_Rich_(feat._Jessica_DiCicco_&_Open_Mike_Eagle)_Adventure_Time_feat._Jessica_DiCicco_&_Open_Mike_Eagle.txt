Water chestnuts roastin' in my gut
Acorns squashin' with the peanut butter cup
I'll tell you what's the difference between a legume and a nut
One goes in your mouth and the other out your butt

Just put the cash into my stash
And I'll give you cashew
Put your face in my almond butter paste, yo
Pecan can do or pecan you don't, bro
On your way out, take a pistachio

Yeah, Yeah (Ha ha ha ha ha)
Yeah (Tell 'em!)
Yeah (How's you mammy and them?)
When I get rich I'ma still act broke
Wake up and put on yesterday's clothes
Walk outside and prolly bum me a smoke
When I get rich (Hold up)

When I get rich I'ma still act broke (Come On)
Wake up and put on yesterday's clothes (Let go)
Walk outside and bum me a smoke
When I get rich I'ma still act broke
I'ma still act broke (You know it)
I'ma still act broke
I'ma still act broke
Yeah, I'ma still act broke

Eyes bloodshot, they knowin' that I'm stoned
When I make it I prolly get kicked outta award shows
Then I'll hit the bar bouncin', spend a couple thousand
Get real drunk and start a fight with a bouncer
Real white trash, 350 pounder
Hit the restaurant and order fresh fish flounder
With a good girl, I mean a classy woman
Half way through tell her I prefer a nasty woman
Man I'm an outlaw, in every sense of the word
You can tell I'm not from around here 'cause I talk with a slur
I love freaky girls, yeah that's just my style
One that'll get up in this truck and go up and down (Come on)

When I get rich I'ma still act broke (Come on)
Wake up and put on yesterday's clothes (Let go)
Walk outside and bum me a smoke
When I get rich I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
I'ma still act broke
I'ma still act broke
I'ma still act broke
Yeah, I'ma still act broke

It's gon' be crazy, when we finally get famous
We gon' break guitars and we gon' jump off stages
We gon' cuss in interviews on the radio station
We gon' get on TV and fuckin' act outrageous
Man I swear, there ain't nothin' changin' over here on Sunset
Waders down, crankin', drinkin' me a beer
I represent the ones that ain't never had shit
In the middle class, we hate them upper class pricks
So when I get rich I'ma still act broke
And step outside and fire up that dope
It's really who I am baby, I can't help it (I can't)
Been known to drank that Hank and smoke Willie Nelson

When I get rich I'ma still act broke (I am)
Wake up and put on yesterday's clothes
Walk outside and bum me a smoke (You know it)
When I get rich I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
Yeah, I'ma still act broke

When I get rich I'ma still act broke
Wake up in the mornin' put on yesterday's clothes
Walk outside and fire up that dope
When I get rich, ha ha ha ha

When I get rich I'ma still act broke (Come on)
Wake up in the mornin' put on yesterday's clothes (Let go)
Walk outside and fire up that dope
When I get rich I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
I'ma still act broke (Whatcha gonna do?)
I'ma still act broke

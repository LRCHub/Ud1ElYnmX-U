Finally getting rich on a bitch
I'll be out breaking down barriers
And I probably might switch on a bitch
But I would never change my character

Yeah I know I got the gunshot
Niggas still keep the poet on
Part the level leave the doze up
Hundreds don't fold up
Niggas stiffer like a nose what
Getting high off the old stuff
Matter what the plug late
But it was early like a lunch date
Bust down that's a bust break
Hungry but I just ate
Shooting dice nigga touch Kate
In a ice to keep the punch straight
Birds on a runway
Hoes doing blade work
Niggas having differences they be form the same turf
I be on a rich way niggas wanna lamer
She just sent me some pictures but it ain't her
Wait let me get ya into other Vegas streets
Silent Tennie's jumping on the stage with me
No plan B work the plot A to Z

Work the plot try'na to park if for

Finally getting rich on a bitch
I'll be out breaking down barriers

And I probably might switch on a bitch
But I would never change my character

I see my baby mama harder than a lot of you niggas
You see I lie to these hoes but I don't lie to the Millions
I made Atlantic Records give my an armlet
Shoot my shoot I miss the face I'm taking over offers it
Who got the West bet breaking I ain't talking rapping
I make them young niggas shoot don't cross my heading
I'ma ball to the bang nigga no laughing
So when petit hit the gram thats a coke action
See I stated with the grams then I fucked a few vans
Got the juice like I'm juice me an orgy
Let me act like the tea and big meat
Praise the Lord for the chopper your priest
And the snitch niggas call me a beast
I got rich and I'm still in the streets

Must repeat this
Blue faced like I'm sea sick
Me and baby Dime on a re-shit

Finally getting rich on a bitch
I'll be out breaking down barriers
And I probably might switch on a bitch
But I would never change my character

Finally getting rich right in front of you
Share with the click that's what brothers do
We just heard the lick with the W

We just heard a lick that's a W
Finally getting rich right in front of you
Share with the click that's what brothers do
We just heard the lick with the W
We just heard a lick that's a W

Finally getting rich on a bitch
I'll be out breaking down barriers
And I probably might switch on a bitch
But I would never change my character
